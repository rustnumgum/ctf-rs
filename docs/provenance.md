# Source provenance

`LICENSE` preserves the upstream notice and terms for adapted material. It is
not a declaration that Edgar Solomonik authored the new Rust implementation.
Do not stamp independently written files with the upstream author's copyright.

* `src/mapping.rs`: map-chain phase/rank and topology reorder/inverse routines
  adapted from `src/mapping/{mapping,topology,distribution}.cxx`.
* `src/tensor.rs`: Rust distributed storage implementation using the upstream
  cyclic distribution and key-bucket exchange approach; not a literal complete
  port of all optimized redistribution kernels.
  Dense slice extraction follows `redistribution/slice.cxx`'s local extraction
  and physical cyclic rank-shift communication; Rust reindexes virtual blocks
  explicitly rather than relying on raw byte copies.
* `src/algebra.rs`, `src/context.rs`, `src/ffi/mpi.rs`: new Rust traits, lifetimes,
  serialization and native-call encapsulation. Upstream responsibility references
  document compatibility targets, not authorship of these files.
* `src/linalg.rs`, `src/ffi/linalg.rs`: new local-kernel interface and bindings to
  standard BLAS/LAPACK operations. No C++ CTF wrapper is linked or copied here.

Keep attribution with actual adaptations and add per-source provenance as the
port grows. The source/test inventory is a scope ledger, not a claim that all
listed source files have been ported.
